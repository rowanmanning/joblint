We're looking for a great VBScript developer who has experience building sexy sites with Microsoft Frontpage. We use Dreamweaver to develop most of our sites, so experience with that is essential. If you can't use Dreamweaver, then you're probably a shit developer anyway. We also need you to know how to write sites with java scripts.

We'd like an enlightened candidate who is at the top of their game; he should be able to hit the ground running. We're a cutting-edge, meritocratic company at the forefront of most industries â€“ we even build sites with ruby on rail.

let's bro down and crush code, web ninjas.
Then we can drink beer and play pool!

Call 01234567890 to apply.
Canidates with beards get extra credit!
